## Getting Started

To set up and run the KooraLive app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```swift
   git clone https://github.com/dalia61/KooraLive.git
   cd KooraLive
   ```
   
2. Install CocoaPods dependencies:
  ```swift
   pod install
   ```
   
3. Open the Xcode workspace and build the app.

## Key Features

The app has two lists:

1. List of Matches: 
   - Explore a curated list of matches. 
   - Each cell represents the teamâ€™s name, flag, the time of the game, and the game result if played.
   - The list is sectioned by day, and the first section is today's match or the next if the current day has no fixtures.
   - Allows you to add or delete matches to your favorites.

2. List of Favorite Matches:
   - Displays favorite matches that are marked.

## Important to know 

-  The app retrieves matches from the JSON endpoint https://api.football-data.org/v4/competitions/2021/matches instead of the V2 endpoint. The V4 endpoint is preferred due to the additional information it provides, such as flags for teams.
 
- Separation of Concerns: MVP divides the application into distinct layers, promoting a clear separation of responsibilities for easier maintenance and debugging.

- Enhanced Code Structure: By incorporating Coordinator, Network, Persistence, and UseCase layers, the architecture achieves a well-organized and cohesive codebase, improving readability and maintainability.
